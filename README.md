# Cloudcraft v1
Some Minecraft backup plugins allow you to upload to the most popular cloud storage services, eg. DriveBackup. Others run their own service, just like we will, and charge you money after 100mb free trial. But both of these solutions have their problems. Neither are encrypted! This is a terrible way to store as if someone hacks the servers they are hosted on, they could just clone your server! But Cloudcraft encrypts your server backup on your server before uploading to our servers, where you can download them in just 1 click!
